## Unlock 3D Real Estate Streaming with Unreal Engine

Explore real estate like never before with 3D streaming using Unreal Engine. Take a full 3D tour of properties and explore every room, hallway, and outdoor space in detail. With 3D streaming on Unreal Engine, you can walk through any home or commercial building as if you're there in real life.

### What is 3D streaming?

We give you the opportunity to view real estate in a game format on any device, even a weak phone or a 10-year-old Macbook. The 3D game is launched on our servers with powerful video cards and broadcast to the screen of your clients.

### Interior customization

Your customers will be able to change and customize the interiors with one touch, while viewing apartments or offices.

### Video chat with a manager during 3D streaming

Managers will help the client with navigation through your real estate objects in 3D space, as well as answer all questions in an anonymous video chat.

### Group 3D presentations

Clients from different parts of the world can view real estate in 3D together. For example, it is convenient if your client needs to consult with his relatives in order to decide on the purchase of real estate.
